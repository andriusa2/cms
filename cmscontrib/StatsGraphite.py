"""A script to periodically extract statistics and send them to a graphite service

CMS config file must have a 'graphite_push' attribute, which is a (host, port) tuple.
Additionally, there can be a 'graphite_interval' attribute, which is time interval
between two data points, in seconds (by default, 1).
